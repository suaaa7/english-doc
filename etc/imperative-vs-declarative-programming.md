# Imperative vs Declarative Programming

https://tylermcginnis.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/

## Summary

Imperative programming is like how you do something, and declarative programming is more like what you do.

---

Many (if not all) declarative approaches have some sort of underlying imperative abstraction.

---

Declarative languages contrast with imperative languages which specify explicit manipulation of the computer’s internal state; or procedural languages which specify an explicit sequence of steps to follow.

---

I draw the line between declarative and non-declarative at whether you can trace the code as it runs. Regex is 100% declarative, as it’s untraceable while the pattern is being executed.
